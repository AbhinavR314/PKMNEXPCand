A way to calculate how many experience candies a Pokemon needs in Sword and Shield to level up to a certain level from level 1.
Just enter the Pokemon name (spelled correctly) and the level you want it to reach to. The code will then spit out how many of each candy you need.

Copy the Python code and you're all set!
